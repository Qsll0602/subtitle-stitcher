# Subtitle Stitcher

## Introduction

A web browser-based subtitle image stitching tool designed for processing subtitle screenshots from movies and videos. Users can upload multiple images through various methods, visually adjust cropping areas, and intelligently stitch selected parts into a new image. All operations are completed locally within the browser without uploading to any server.

The source code of this project was primarily generated by AI, currently iterated through three versions. The motivation stems from the author's experience sharing video or movie content in messaging apps, where stitching multiple subtitle images proved more efficient for conveying information compared to sending videos or single images. Unable to find a suitable lightweight subtitle stitching tool, the author prompted AI to create this local stitcher, which currently functions adequately; for learning reference only (if deemed valuable).

## Features

### Upload Methods
- **File Selection**: Click the "Select Images" button to upload
- **Drag-and-drop Upload**: Directly drag image files into the workspace (e.g., dragging from a WeChat chat box to the webpage's workspace, a method the author particularly favors)
- **Paste Screenshot**: Press Ctrl+V to paste screenshots from clipboard

### Cropping
- **Visual Adjustment**: Select regions by dragging the green crop edges; the other dimension in the same cropping direction is fixed to the image's full dimension in that direction
- **Dual Orientation**: Supports both horizontal and vertical cropping modes
- **Independent Settings**: Each image can have individually configured cropping area and orientation (though separate orientation settings may have limited practical significance)

### Editing
- **Drag-and-drop Reordering**: Adjust image order by dragging
- **Quick Delete**: Remove single images by clicking the delete button in the top-right corner
- **Batch Clear**: Clear all images with one click to start over
- **Result Reuse**: Drag generated images back to the workspace for further editing

### Stitching
- **Auto-alignment**: Automatically stitches based on the first image's orientation
- **Output**: Maintains original image quality during stitching
- **Preview**: Real-time result display on the right after processing

### Export
- **One-click Download**: Download the stitched result image

## Important Notes

1. **Security**: All image processing occurs locally in the browser and is not uploaded to any server
2. **Recommendations**: Recommended to process no more than 15 images at once, with each image under 5MB

4. **Operation Tip**: When drag-reordering, drag the gray area around images, not the images themselves
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Recommended to use relatively recent browser versions
